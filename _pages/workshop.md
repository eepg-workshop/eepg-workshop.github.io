The EEPGW online workshop will be held every other week on Fridays between 5:00-6:00 PM Central European Time (8:00-9:00 AM PST, 11:00-12:00 AM EST). Every other meeting will be a paper presentation. This will last one hour. Participants will be expected to read the paper ahead of the meeting. After a brief presentation by the author(s), a discussant will provide comments and suggestions. We then open the floor for further questions and comments from the audience. Please register for our listserv to recieve the Zoom link and paper for each workshop.

# Statement on Russia's War Against Ukraine
The EEPGW wholeheartedly condemns Russia’s attacks on Ukraine's sovereignty over the last ten years and its recent full-scale invasion of Ukraine. We stand in support of Ukraine and its people as they fight in support of their country and freedom. For more information on the war, and how to support the Ukrainian war effort, refugees, and media, we include resources compiled by [Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute](https://huri.harvard.edu/russia-ukraine-war) and [Razom for Ukraine](https://www.razomforukraine.org/).
